# Background  
The goal of this hands-on session is ...**Add Your Class Text Here**...

The folowing text is taken from the [labsheet package](https://github.com/bioboot/labsheet) template demonstrating how instructors can create interactive web documents that students can use in self-guided learning.

The labsheet package provides a number of functions that you use in [inline R code](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf) to create HTML widgets (text boxes, pull down menus, and buttons that reveal hidden content such as hints and solutions). These features are based on on ideas from [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) and functions from the **webex** and **learnr** packages.  


# Examples
Example use of labsheet function use is given below. Knit this file to HTML to see how it works.

`r question_start()`
<p style="color: gray;">**Side-note:**  To fully engage with this worksheet please provide your answers in the red rectangles after each question. Correct answers will be indicated by a change of rectangle color. For example, type 2 in the first question box and note color change: </p> 

- **Q.** What is 1+1? `r fitb("2")`
- **Q.** Type a vowel: `r fitb(c("A", "E", "I", "O" , "U"), ignore_case = TRUE)`
- **Q.** Complete, "Never gonna give you up, never gonna: `r mcq(c("let you go", "turn you down", "run away", answer = "let you down"))`"
- **Q.** True or False? You can permute values in a vector using `sample()`. `r torf(TRUE)`

`r hide("More deatils")`
Buttons such as this one can be used to provide additional hints, background information, or answers on an optional basis (i.e. click to hide/reveal this content).  

**We recommend that you attempt the questions before revealing these additional details.** 
`r unhide()`
`r question_end()`


## Plot problem

`r question_start()`
**Recreate the scatterplot below, using the built-in `cars` dataset.**

```{r echo = FALSE}
with(cars, plot(speed, dist, xlab="Speed (mph)", ylab="Stopping Distance (ft)"))
```

`r hide("I need a hint")`
See the documentation for `plot()` (`?plot`)
`r unhide()`

<!-- Note: Could also just set the code chunk option labsheet.hide to TRUE -->

```{r eval = FALSE, labsheet.hide="**Solution**"}
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```
`r question_end()`


# About this document

Here we use the `sessionInfo()` function to report on our R systems setup at the time of document execution.
